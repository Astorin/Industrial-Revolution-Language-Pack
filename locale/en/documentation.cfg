paragraph_IndustrialRevolution3_1=Welcome to Industrial Revolution 3. On the left-hand menu, you can find guidance on some of the mod's main features.
paragraph_IndustrialRevolution3_2=Some general advice on differences from vanilla Factorio:
paragraph_IndustrialRevolution3_3=This mod was made by Deadlock989, 2018-2023, in about 3000 hours. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0. Have fun.

bullet_IndustrialRevolution3_1=Hand-crafting will take you a very long time because there are many, many more components and intermediates. You should be automating.
bullet_IndustrialRevolution3_2=You can't smelt iron at the start of the game (unless you change the starting technology level in the mod's map settings).
bullet_IndustrialRevolution3_3=When you unlock iron smelting, the nearest ore patch might be some way off. You may have to set up a temporary bootstrap outpost.
bullet_IndustrialRevolution3_4=Dry, hot map settings can make getting hold of rubber trees much more difficult. You will have to search them out.
bullet_IndustrialRevolution3_5=Monowheels are unlocked quite early. They are cheaper and faster than cars, making it easy to explore, but they are unarmed.
bullet_IndustrialRevolution3_6=Circuit networks are pretty much compulsory for some processing chains, oil processing and ore washing in particular.
bullet_IndustrialRevolution3_7=Always check machine and recipe stats before you start spamming things down. Don't assume vanilla ratios.

paragraph_ir_entity_toggle_1=IR3 provides a hotkey that lets you interact with particular machines without having to open their GUIs. The current keybinding is __CONTROL__ir-entity-adjustment__.
paragraph_ir_entity_toggle_2=To toggle a machine or interact with it, hover your cursor over one of the following and press the hotkey. 

bullet_ir_entity_toggle_1=[font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Trains[/color][/font] are toggled between manual and automatic modes. If you are riding a train, it is toggled without having to hover the cursor.
bullet_ir_entity_toggle_2=[font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Photonic cannons[/color][/font] are toggled between wide and narrow arcs of fire.
bullet_ir_entity_toggle_3=[font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Aetheric lamps[/color][/font] are toggled between a passthrough version (two connections) and a pipe-ending variant (one connection).
bullet_ir_entity_toggle_4=[font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Power switches[/color][/font] are toggled on or off.
bullet_ir_entity_toggle_5=[font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Constant combinator[/color][/font] signal output is toggled on or off.
bullet_ir_entity_toggle_6=[font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Chests[/color][/font] and other containers can have items pulled from them or pushed into them without opening them (see [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Inventory transfers[/color][/font]).
bullet_ir_entity_toggle_7=[font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Battery generators[/color][/font] will have their power output priority toggled between the default low priority (equal to accumulators, i.e. will only consume batteries when primary generators are insufficient) or a higher priority (equal to other generators, i.e. will charge accumulators).
bullet_ir_entity_toggle_8=[font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Metal casts[/color][/font] will be cycled between the four component types (ingots, plates, gears, rods).
bullet_ir_entity_toggle_9=[font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Barrelling machines[/color][/font] are toggled between filling and emptying mode.
bullet_ir_entity_toggle_10=[font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Electric boilers[/color][/font] and [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]geothermal exchangers[/color][/font] are toggled between hot water and steam output modes.

paragraph_ir_fuelman_1=IR3 provides generators for your armour's equipment grid that burn fuels or use up charged batteries. Vehicles also require fuel. Managing fuels in multiple places at once can get tedious. Fortunately, in IR3, you can automate it.
paragraph_ir_fuelman_2=If you have any generators in your power armour, or if you are driving a vehicle that uses fuel, the fuel manager quickbar toggle will be unlocked (current keybinding is __CONTROL__ir-control-fuel-manager__). If the manager is toggled on, it will periodically check any fuel slots it can find. If any fuel levels get too low, the manager will top them up for you, as long as you have some of the same kind of fuel in your main inventory. If there are any spent items accumulating (such as empty barrels or discharged batteries), the manager will try to clear them out.
paragraph_ir_fuelman_3=If any items are moved between inventories, a small notification will appear above your character, showing how many. If the fuel manager encounters an issue, the notification will include warning icons:
paragraph_ir_fuelman_4=While you are driving a vehicle, its fuel slots and equipment grid are managed in the same way as your armour equipment. The manager has access to both your personal inventory and the vehicle's trunk. For your personal armour equipment, your personal inventory takes priority over the trunk as the source of fuel. For the vehicle's slots, the trunk takes priority. Trains are not counted as "driving" and are not managed, even in manual mode.
paragraph_ir_fuelman_5=When fuel slots are empty, the manager will try and use the first compatible fuel it can find. It gives priority to slot ownership first (vehicle trunks versus your own equipment), then to filtered slots (fuels in filtered inventory slots are always chosen before non-filtered), and then to inventory slot order (left to right, top to bottom).
paragraph_ir_fuelman_6=You can disable specific warnings and sounds: see Settings > Mod settings > Per player.

bullet_ir_fuelman_1=A fuel inventory is low on fuel and would be topped up, but you don't have any of the same fuel item available.
bullet_ir_fuelman_2=A fuel inventory is empty, but you don't have any compatible fuels available.
bullet_ir_fuelman_3=A "spent fuel" inventory has items in it, but there is no space for them anywhere else.

paragraph_ir_mining_1=Mining drills are used on all of the usual ore deposits: [img=item/coal] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]coal[/color][/font], [img=item/stone] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]stone[/color][/font], [img=item/copper-ore] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]copper[/color][/font], [img=item/iron-ore] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]iron[/color][/font] and [img=item/uranium-ore] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]uranium[/color][/font]. IR3 also adds deposits of [img=item/tin-ore] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]tin[/color][/font] and [img=item/gold-ore] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]gold[/color][/font]. The ability to smelt iron and gold requires research and development. To begin with, your main resources are copper, tin, coal and stone.
paragraph_ir_mining_2=Ingots are the main product of ore smelting, representing a relatively pure lump of metal which requires further crafting. Some elemental metals can be combined to produce alloys with new properties; for example, [img=item/tin-ingot] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]tin[/color][/font] and [img=item/copper-ingot] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]copper[/color][/font] can produce [img=item/bronze-ingot] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]bronze[/color][/font].
paragraph_ir_mining_3=[img=item/nickel-pure] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Nickel[/color][/font], [img=item/lead-pure] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]lead[/color][/font], [img=item/chromium-pure] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]chromium[/color][/font], and [img=item/platinum-pure] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]platinum[/color][/font] are rare metallic minerals, present in small amounts in other metal ores. They cannot be mined independently: only the ore washing process can recover them. 
paragraph_ir_mining_4=Pumpjacks are used to extract [img=fluid/crude-oil] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]crude oil[/color][/font]. You may also encounter relatively rare fissures that emit gases or steam. [img=item/copper-derrick] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Steam derricks[/color][/font] can only be placed on [img=fluid/steam] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]steam fissures[/color][/font] and are self-powering. [img=item/steel-derrick] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Electric derricks[/color][/font] can be used with any kind of fissure and benefit from modules. Unlike oil patches, fissures are cyclic: their rate of output decreases until it reaches a minimum, at which point it bursts back at full strength again.
paragraph_ir_mining_5=Sometimes you might notice twinkling rocks on an ore deposit. These contain precious stones.

paragraph_ir_pollution_control_1=Pollution in Factorio is based on chunks, which are 32x32 tile sections of the world: you can see the chunk grid when you pause the game. Every chunk has a pollution value. If a machine emits pollution, it is added to the pollution value of the chunk the machine is in. Over time, the pollution spreads to neighbouring chunks; some natural features (such as trees and biter nests) absorb some of it. If a machine has negative emissions, they are subtracted from the pollution in that chunk, but a chunk cannot have less than zero pollution.
paragraph_ir_pollution_control_2=IR3 provides a few machines which help to work against the spread of pollution. A [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]mouse-over visualisation[/color][/font] is displayed when you point the cursor at any machine with a negative pollution effect, showing the boundary of the affected chunk.

bullet_ir_pollution_control_1=[font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Air compressors[/color][/font] reduce pollution by producing clean compressed air, consuming filters and electricity.
bullet_ir_pollution_control_2=[font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Air purifiers[/color][/font] work in the same way as compressors but automatically vent the cleaned air. The effects of multiple compressors or purifiers within a chunk will stack with each other (up to the point of zero pollution).
bullet_ir_pollution_control_3=[font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Forestries[/color][/font] also have a pollution-reducing effect (in addition to the natural effect of the trees they are managing), but their cleaning effects within a chunk do not stack with each other. See the page on Forestries for details.

paragraph_ir_pollution_spill_1=In IR3, many liquids and gases are pollutants. Polluting gases will add to the spread of pollution if they are vented into the world with a [img=item/iron-gas-vent] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]gas vent[/color][/font]. Some gases, notably [img=fluid/sulphur-gas] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]sour gas[/color][/font] and [img=fluid/carbon-gas] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]carbon dioxide[/color][/font], will probably have to be vented at some point: think of these gases as pollution that you can redirect or spread out to avoid concentrated hotspots or lure enemies away from key locations.
paragraph_ir_pollution_spill_2=However, venting is not the only way of releasing fluid pollutants. If a [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]tank[/color][/font] or a [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]pipe[/color][/font] or a similar object is removed or destroyed while it has a pollutant in it and there is nowhere else in the fluid system for it to flow to, the fluid is released and an instant burst of pollution is spilled. The same applies to flushing pipes manually using a pipe's GUI.
paragraph_ir_pollution_spill_3=The amount of pollution released by a spill depends partly on which fluid it was, but more importantly, how much of it. For the contents of a single piece of pipe, the spill is very likely nothing to worry about. But a storage tank with 25,000 units of fluid in it can produce a very significant spill. Riskiest of all is flushing entire fluid systems, which can potentially spill horrible amounts of pollution. Of course, you may not care.
paragraph_ir_pollution_spill_4=The following liquids and gases are [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]not[/color][/font] pollutants and are completely safe to flush or vent:

bullet_ir_power_sources_1=[font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Burner[/color][/font] machines and equipment require coal or another solid chemical fuel to operate: these include boilers, furnaces, burner drills and burner inserters. In general, the more processed a fuel is, the higher its fuel value and/or the less polluting it is. Burner inserters in IR3 will "leech" fuel from fuel slots if they are unloading a burner machine.
bullet_ir_power_sources_2=[font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Steam[/color][/font] machines operate by transforming pressurised steam into mechanical motion. Steam power is the only way to set up automated crafting and ore processing in the early stages of a game. Boilers convert water to steam, which can then be piped through steam machines. 
bullet_ir_power_sources_3=[font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Electric machines[/color][/font] require a power supply from an electric network via poles, pylons, or substations.
bullet_ir_power_sources_4=[font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Fluid fuel machines[/color][/font] burn flammable liquids or gases (e.g. gas furnaces and generators).
bullet_ir_power_sources_5=[font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Batteries[/color][/font] are rechargeable fuel items, essentially bottled electricity. They can be used to supply an electric network using battery generators, or to power a personal equipment grid using discharge equipment, or they can serve as renewable vehicle and locomotive fuel. Batteries have a small chance to "fizzle" on charging, losing the battery; higher tier batteries have a lower chance of failure.
bullet_ir_power_sources_6=[font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Barrelled fuel[/color][/font] and [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]canister fuel[/color][/font] is mostly used by vehicles and locomotives, occasionally in grid equipment. An empty canister or barrel is returned when the fuel is spent.

paragraph_ir_processing_1=IR3 features additional intermediate steps for ore processing, effectively boosting raw ore yields from quite early on in the game. In some cases these processes are optional - you can still smelt raw ores if you want to - but there are always benefits to extra processing.
paragraph_ir_processing_2=[img=item/steel-grinder] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Crushers[/color][/font] are typically used to pulverise raw ores or reduce stone to gravel and silica. Crushing metallic ores results in an increased ingot yield and less pollution from smelting. Crushers are also used to extract rubber from rubber wood. [img=item/steel-mixer] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Mixers[/color][/font] have a similar role, but they can handle multiple ingredients at once and can also add fluids to the mix; they require a manual recipe selection.
paragraph_ir_processing_3=[img=item/steel-washer] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Ore washers[/color][/font] increase the yield of crushed ores even further, rinsing them in hot or cold water to flush out impurities and produce clean minerals. As a bonus, washing also separates out rare mineral byproducts that can't be mined separately. Heated water from an [img=item/steel-boiler] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]electric boiler[/color][/font] is more effective for byproduct separation, but you don't want too much: [img=item/pump] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]pumps[/color][/font], [img=item/small-tank] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]small buffer tanks[/color][/font] and [img=item/green-wire] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]circuit networks[/color][/font] can be used to set up unattended ore washing plants which adjust the mineral output ratio to demand. The washing cycle produces polluted water: [img=item/steel-cleaner] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]cleaners[/color][/font] can be used to recover most of the clean water by filtering out the waste. 
paragraph_ir_processing_4=[img=item/iron-scrapper] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Scrapping machines[/color][/font] turn crafted items into scrap, as long as they have metal, stone, wood, glass, or concrete in their crafting history. Scrap can then be re-smelted into ingots or sheets, recovering resources from unwanted items. The resource return is random but averages out at 75%. Scrapping only reverses crafting processes, and not smelting, crushing, or chemistry. Items that contain a lot of fluid (e.g. barrels, canisters) cannot be scrapped.

paragraph_ir_productivity_1=[img=item/productivity-module-3] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Productivity modules[/color][/font] can be used with labs, drills and the following crafting recipes:

paragraph_ir_transmats_1=Transmats are a branch of quantum field ring technology that employs subspace tunnelling to transfer an engineer's atoms very quickly from one platform to another. Setting up multiple transmats around the world will form a network. Clicking on a transmat will open its interface and show possible destinations. If the status for both transmats is shown as [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Ready[/color][/font], transport can be initiated by clicking on the [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Engage[/color][/font] button. Transmats can only make a connection if all of the following conditions are met:
paragraph_ir_transmats_2=You can edit the name of the transmat by clicking on the [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Edit[/color][/font] button. Edited names are preserved in blueprints and copy-pasting. You can also toggle an automatic map marker at the transmat's position.
paragraph_ir_transmats_3=The designers of transmat technology cannot be held responsible for existential ennui or clinical disassociation triggered by transmat travel, and would like to emphasise that there is a very sound argument that you are still the same person now and not a complete stranger wearing your copied face and dreaming your copied dreams.

bullet_ir_transmats_1=At least one engineer must be standing on the initiating transmat, within the field ring.
bullet_ir_transmats_2=Both of the transmats must have enough power in their energy buffers. Distance does not affect the power required.
bullet_ir_transmats_3=The destination transmat must not be obstructed by another engineer. Vehicles also obstruct transmat operation at both ends.

paragraph_ir_weapons_1=IR3 adds and changes some weapon and ammo mechanics, as well as reworking the military technology tree. All bullets in this mod are physical projectiles with a travel time, whether they are fired from a shotgun, a submachine gun or a turret. Bullets will pass over your own buildings.

bullet_ir_weapons_1=[font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Scattergun turrets[/color][/font] are your first available automated defence. They use short range [img=item/shotgun-shell] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]cartridge ammo[/color][/font], which spreads out.
bullet_ir_weapons_2=[font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Autogun turrets[/color][/font] have longer range and focus on a single target. They use [img=item/firearm-magazine] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]magazine ammo[/color][/font]. 
bullet_ir_weapons_3=[font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Laser turrets[/color][/font] fire a high energy beam at a single target. You can change the colour of the beam in the mod's settings.
bullet_ir_weapons_4=[font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Arc turrets[/color][/font] don't deal any damage: they strike a cluster of enemies with an electric pulse, slowing them down for a short time.
bullet_ir_weapons_5=[font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Photonic cannons[/color][/font] fire explosive energy projectiles and are quite deadly. Don't point them towards your own base.
bullet_ir_weapons_6=The weapon of last resort is the [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]atomic artillery shell[/color][/font], which devastates enemy bases but releases a massive cloud of pollution.

paragraph_ir_melting_1=[img=item/stone-furnace][img=item/bronze-furnace][img=item/electric-furnace][img=item/steel-furnace] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Furnaces[/color][/font] are typically used to smelt metal ores and minerals into ingots. You can pre-process ores using crushers and washers to get better ingot yields and produce less pollution (see Processing). Most furnaces can also work with non-metals, such as glass and graphite.
paragraph_ir_melting_2=[img=item/stone-alloy-furnace][img=item/bronze-alloy-furnace][img=item/electric-alloy-furnace] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Alloy furnaces[/color][/font] work with multiple ingredients to produce metal alloys and reductions. They require a manual recipe selection.
paragraph_ir_melting_3=[img=item/blast-furnace] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Blast furnaces[/color][/font] are specialist combustion furnaces which focus on producing key materials efficiently. They work very rapidly, but they require supplies of [img=fluid/air-gas] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]compressed air[/color][/font] and [img=item/solid-fuel] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]coke[/color][/font].
paragraph_ir_melting_4=[img=item/arc-furnace] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Arc furnaces[/color][/font] require a lot of space and power, but they work fast. They produce molten metals, which can be cast into ingots, plates, gears, and rods using [img=item/steel-cast] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]metal casts[/color][/font]. When processing minerals in an arc furnace, pure [img=fluid/oxygen-gas] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]oxygen gas[/color][/font] is required. This is the most productive way of processing minerals: the full crushing, washing, arc melting and casting chain yields triple the ingots compared to smelting raw ore. Arc furnaces cannot process raw or crushed ores, but pure forms of metal can be melted (e.g. ingots and scrap). For these non-mineral recipes, oxygen is not required but there is no production bonus. Molten metals can also be mixed to create molten alloys.
paragraph_ir_melting_5=Blast furnaces and arc furnaces are not direct upgrades from an electric furnace; they have pros and cons, providing playstyle flexibility. They can both produce [img=fluid/carbon-gas] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]carbon dioxide[/color][/font] waste, as do some other chemical processes. Carbon dioxide has a niche use in forestries but you may need to vent it (see Pollution spills).

paragraph_ir_forestry_1=Forestries are chunk-based buildings which manage nearby trees in order to automate wood production. [img=item/bronze-forestry] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Bronze forestries[/color][/font] are slow but do not require fuel, just water. [img=item/iron-forestry] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Electric forestries[/color][/font] are faster but require electricity as well. [img=item/chrome-forestry] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Advanced forestries[/color][/font] are faster still and require electricity, fertiliser and carbon dioxide. All have a pollution-reducing effect in addition to the natural absorption of the trees.
paragraph_ir_forestry_2=The production rate scales with the number of trees in the same chunk as the forestry, up to a maximum of __1__ trees; no trees, no wood. Dead or dry trees are not counted. Rubber trees take priority: if there are any rubber trees in the chunk, other trees are ignored. Forestries will get off to a flying start if they are set up within existing forests; if this is not possible, you can craft [img=item/tree-planter-tree-01][img=item/tree-planter-ir-rubber-tree] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]tree beds[/color][/font] to manually populate a chunk with trees. Tree beds can be included in blueprints, cut and pasted, and placed by robots.
paragraph_ir_forestry_3=The tree population will change as the daylight cycle passes. Usually it will increase until the maximum is reached. Smaller tree populations grow more slowly. New trees only grow in empty space and will not grow on artificial tiles such as brick or concrete. However, managed trees that reach a critical level of pollution damage will die off, so the population may also shrink or even crash. This depends on your map settings: see the official Factorio wiki on trees for details on pollution damage. Forestries will display a [img=virtual-signal/ir-signal-toxic] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]warning[/color][/font] if they detect a chunk pollution level beyond the harmful threshold.
paragraph_ir_forestry_4=There is no advantage to having more than one forestry in a chunk. Available trees are split between the forestries, so the same amount of wood is produced on average and the same amount of pollution is absorbed. Holding your cursor over a forestry will highlight the chunk boundary it is within, which trees it is currently managing, and any other forestries in the same chunk that it is competing with.

paragraph_ir_transfers_1=Inventory transfers are a low tech substitute for personal logistics that works with filtered inventory slots. It uses the following inventories:
bullet_ir_transfers_1=Your main inventory and the ammo slots for your equipped weapons;
bullet_ir_transfers_2=The trunk and ammo slots of any car-type vehicle that you are currently driving;
bullet_ir_transfers_3=Chests and other static containers.
paragraph_ir_transfers_2=There are two ways of triggering a transfer. You can use the [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]toggle hotkey[/color][/font] (currently bound to __CONTROL__ir-entity-adjustment__) on a chest or container: this works with groups of chests within a short range. You can also set up a [img=item/delivery-plate] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]delivery plate[/color][/font] and then trigger a transfer by walking or driving over it, or remain standing or parked on it: this works with every container in a slightly larger range. The hotkey must be opted into (see Settings > Mod settings > Per player), but delivery plates will always work on all supported containers regardless of the hotkey setting.
paragraph_ir_transfers_3=When a transfer has been triggered, if you have filtered any of your own inventory slots by using __CONTROL__toggle-filter__, the transfer will attempt to fill those slots by "pulling" matching items from the chests in range. You can also "push" items out of your inventory by setting up filtered slots in chests that support them (e.g. non-logistics containers). Ammo slots are exempt from pushing. Pushing takes priority over pulling, so if your inventory and a chest have overlapping filters, the chest takes priority.
paragraph_ir_transfers_4=Examples of typical inventory transfer tasks:
bullet_ir_transfers_4=Setting up a steam cell or charged battery filter in your inventory, and an empty cell or empty battery filter in a chest next to a charger, so that you can automate topping up and recharging your personal or vehicle fuels.
bullet_ir_transfers_5=Setting your vehicle's trunk filters to iron ore, visiting an outpost and filling up with ore by driving over a delivery plate, and then driving to a smelting centre and delivering the ore to chests that are also filtered for the ore. Bonus points for not even stopping the vehicle.
