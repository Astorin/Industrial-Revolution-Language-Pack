paragraph_IndustrialRevolution_1=Welcome to Industrial Revolution 2. It's assumed that you have experience with vanilla Factorio and can figure out basic operations for yourself. On the left-hand menu, you can find topics detailing some less obvious features of the mod.
paragraph_IndustrialRevolution_2=Some general advice:
paragraph_IndustrialRevolution_3=This mod was made by Deadlock989, 2018-2021, and took about 2000 hours. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0. Have fun.
bullet_IndustrialRevolution_1=Hand-crafting can take a long time because there are more components and intermediates. You should be automating.
bullet_IndustrialRevolution_2=You can't smelt iron at the start of the game (unless you change the starting technology level in the mod's map settings).
bullet_IndustrialRevolution_3=When you get to iron smelting, the nearest iron ore patch might be some way off. You may have to set up a temporary outpost.
bullet_IndustrialRevolution_4=Monowheels are unlocked quite early. They are cheaper and faster than cars, making it easy to explore.
bullet_IndustrialRevolution_5=Check machine stats before you start spamming them down. Don't assume vanilla ratios or numbers.
bullet_IndustrialRevolution_6=Some map settings can make getting hold of rubber trees more difficult. Use a monowheel to explore or opt for a starter kit.
bullet_IndustrialRevolution_7=Circuit networks are pretty much compulsory for some late game processing chains, ore washing in particular.

paragraph_ir2_entity_toggle_1=IR2 provides a hotkey that lets you adjust the behaviour of some machines without having to open their GUIs. The current keybinding is __CONTROL__ir2-entity-adjustment__.
paragraph_ir2_entity_toggle_2=To toggle a machine, hover your cursor over one of the following and press the hotkey:
bullet_ir2_entity_toggle_1=[font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Trains[/color][/font] are toggled between manual and automatic modes. If you are riding a train, it is toggled without having to hover the cursor.
bullet_ir2_entity_toggle_2=[font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Photonic cannons[/color][/font] are toggled between wide and narrow arcs of fire.
bullet_ir2_entity_toggle_3=[font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Aetheric lamps[/color][/font] are toggled between a passthrough version (two connections) and a pipe-ending variant (one connection).
bullet_ir2_entity_toggle_4=[font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Power switches[/color][/font] are toggled on or off.
bullet_ir2_entity_toggle_5=[font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Constant combinator[/color][/font] signal output is toggled on or off.
bullet_ir2_entity_toggle_6=[font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Chests[/color][/font] and other containers will have their contents (if any) sorted and merged.

paragraph_ir2_fuelman_1=IR2 provides equipment grid generators that burn fuel or discharge batteries. Vehicles also require fuel. Keeping fuel slots topped up by hand can be tedious. Fortunately, in IR2, you can automate it.
paragraph_ir2_fuelman_2=If you have any generators in your power armour or if you are driving a vehicle that needs fuel, the fuel manager quickbar toggle will be unlocked (current keybinding is __CONTROL__ir2-control-fuel-manager__). If the manager is toggled on and any fuel levels get too low, the manager will try to top them up with the same kind of fuel. If there are any spent items (such as empty batteries), the manager will try to clear them out. If any items are moved in or out of inventories, a notification will appear above your character, showing how many. If the fuel manager encounters an issue, the notification will include warning icons:
paragraph_ir2_fuelman_3=While you are driving, the vehicle's fuel and its equipment grid are managed in the same way as your armour equipment, and the manager has access to both your personal inventory and the vehicle's trunk. For your armour equipment, your inventory has priority over the trunk. For the vehicle, the trunk has priority. Locomotives and wagons do not count as "driving" and are not managed.
paragraph_ir2_fuelman_4=You can disable specific warnings and sounds: see Settings > Mod settings > Per player.
bullet_ir2_fuelman_1=A fuel inventory needs topping up, but you don't have any of the same fuel available.
bullet_ir2_fuelman_2=An empty fuel inventory was found. No action is taken because the manager does not know which fuel you would prefer to use.
bullet_ir2_fuelman_3=A "spent fuel" inventory has items in it, but there is no space for them anywhere else.

paragraph_ir2_mining_1=IR2 features the usual resource deposits from vanilla Factorio: [img=item/coal] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]coal[/color][/font], [img=item/stone] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]stone[/color][/font], [img=item/copper-ore] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]copper[/color][/font], [img=item/iron-ore] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]iron[/color][/font] and [img=item/uranium-ore] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]uranium[/color][/font]. In addition, you will find deposits of [img=item/tin-ore] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]tin[/color][/font] and [img=item/gold-ore] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]gold[/color][/font]. The ability to smelt iron and gold requires research. To begin with, your primary resources are copper and tin.
paragraph_ir2_mining_2=Occasionally you might find an ore deposit that contains a scattering of rare gemstones. These include [img=item/ruby-gem] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]rubies[/color][/font], [img=item/sapphire-gem] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]sapphires[/color][/font], and [img=item/diamond-gem] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]diamonds[/color][/font]. Specific gems are associated with specific kinds of ore. Not every ore patch will have gems in it. Gem-bearing ore resources can be hard to spot, although there are visual clues both in the world and on the map once you know what you are looking for. Later in the game, a high-tech method of synthesising gems becomes available. However, powdered gems (natural or synthesised) are needed as seeds, so you need to find some gems to kickstart that line of processing.
paragraph_ir2_mining_3=[img=item/nickel-pure] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Nickel[/color][/font], [img=item/lead-pure] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]lead[/color][/font], [img=item/chromium-pure] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]chromium[/color][/font], and [img=item/tellurium-pure] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]tellurium[/color][/font] do not occur independently. They must be extracted from processed ores.

paragraph_ir2_pollution_control_1=IR2 provides machines which help to work against the spread of pollution.
paragraph_ir2_pollution_control_2=Pollution in Factorio is based on chunks, which are 32x32 tile sections of the world: you can see the chunk grid when you pause the game. Every chunk has a pollution value. If a machine emits pollution, it is added to the pollution value of the chunk the machine is in. Pollution spreads out to neighbouring chunks; some natural features reduce it. If a machine has negative emissions, they are subtracted from the pollution in that chunk until it reaches zero. IR2 displays an [img=selection-box] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]alt-mode visualisation[/color][/font] when you point the cursor at any machine that has a negative pollution effect, showing the boundary of the affected chunk. Since a chunk's pollution cannot go below zero, you may want to avoid having too many anti-pollution machines in the same chunk.
bullet_ir2_pollution_control_1=[font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Forestries[/color][/font] are mainly used to grow wood, but they also have a small anti-pollution effect.
bullet_ir2_pollution_control_2=[font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Air purification towers[/color][/font] are more effective, but they consume resources.

paragraph_ir2_pollution_spill_1=Some liquids and gases are pollutants. If a [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]storage tank[/color][/font] or [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]pipe[/color][/font] is deconstructed or destroyed while it has a polluting fluid in it, pollution is immediately released into the world. The same also applies to manually flushing a fluid system.
paragraph_ir2_pollution_spill_2=The amount of pollution released depends partly on which fluid it was, but also on how much fluid was lost. For the contents of a single piece of pipe, the released pollution is nothing to worry about. But if it was a storage tank with 25,000 units of fluid in it, the pollution burst can be significant. Most risky of all is flushing entire fluid systems, which can delete hundreds of thousands of units of fluid or more.
paragraph_ir2_pollution_spill_3=The most polluting fluid is crude oil, the least is polluted water. Molten metals and molten glass are also pollutants.

paragraph_ir2_power_sources_1=Machines in IR2 have three different kinds of power source.
paragraph_ir2_power_sources_2=[img=tooltip-category-chemical] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Burner machines[/color][/font] require coal or some other solid chemical fuel to operate. These include boilers, furnaces, burner drills and burner inserters. Burner inserters in IR2 will "leech" fuel from fuel slots if they are unloading a burner machine.
paragraph_ir2_power_sources_3=[img=tooltip-category-steam] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Steam machines[/color][/font] operate by transforming pressurised steam into mechanical motion. In the early stages of an IR2 game, steam power is the only way to set up automated crafting and ore processing. A copper boiler is used to convert water to steam, which can then be piped to (and usually through) steam machines. 
paragraph_ir2_power_sources_4=[img=tooltip-category-electricity] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Electric machines[/color][/font] require a power supply from an electric network. In IR2, electricity is unlocked with steam engines, which requires you to get past the iron smelting milestone. Many electric processing machines show their operating status with coloured lights: you can adjust the colours in Settings > Mod settings > Startup.

paragraph_ir2_processing_1=IR2 features additional intermediate steps for ore processing, effectively boosting raw ore yields from quite early on in the game. In some cases these processes are optional - you can still smelt raw ores if you want to - but there are always benefits to extra processing.
paragraph_ir2_processing_2=[img=item/copper-grinder][img=item/iron-grinder][img=item/steel-grinder] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Crushers[/color][/font] are typically used to pulverise raw ores or reduce stone to gravel and silica. Crushing metallic ores results in an increased ingot yield. Crushers are also used to extract rubber from rubber wood.
paragraph_ir2_processing_3=[img=item/copper-mixer][img=item/iron-mixer][img=item/steel-mixer] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Mixers[/color][/font] are a specialist form of crusher that require a manual recipe selection. They are mainly used to produce alloy mixes for smelting, but they can also combine crushed materials with water to produce flooring and other products.
paragraph_ir2_processing_4=[img=item/steel-washer] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Ore washers[/color][/font] further increase the yield of crushed ores by producing purified minerals. Ore washing also separates out rarer metallic minerals which would otherwise be lost. Washing requires fluid, which becomes polluted during the washing process. A [img=item/steel-cleaner] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]polluted water cleaner[/color][/font] can be used to filter out impurities, restoring some of the clean water. [img=item/pump] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Pumps[/color][/font], [img=item/small-tank] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]small buffer tanks[/color][/font] and [img=item/green-wire] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]circuit networks[/color][/font] are likely to be useful in rigging up unattended ore washing plants and managing ratios.
paragraph_ir2_processing_5=[img=item/iron-scrapper] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Scrapping machines[/color][/font] can turn crafted items into scrap, as long as they have at least some metal, stone, wood or glass in their crafting history. Scrap can then be re-smelted into ingots or sheets. This is a good way of recovering resources from unwanted or obsolete items. You are guaranteed to get at least half of the materials used to make the item. Scrapping can only "reverse" crafting processes, and not smelting, grinding, chemistry or electroplating.

paragraph_ir2_productivity_1=[img=item/productivity-module-3] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Productivity modules[/color][/font] can be used with labs, drills and the following recipes:

paragraph_ir2_transmats_1=Transmats (short for "transmaterialisation platforms") are a branch of quantum field ring technology that employs hyperspatial slipstream tunnelling to transfer engineers very quickly from site to site. Setting up multiple transmats around the world will form a network. Clicking on a transmat will open its interface and show possible destinations. If the status for both transmats is shown as [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Ready[/color][/font], transport can be initiated by clicking on the [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Engage[/color][/font] button. Transmats can only make a connection if all of the following conditions are met:
paragraph_ir2_transmats_2=You can edit the name of the transmat by clicking on the [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Edit[/color][/font] button. Edited names are preserved in blueprints and copy-pasting.

bullet_ir2_transmats_1=At least one engineer must be standing on the initiating transmat, within the field ring.
bullet_ir2_transmats_2=Both of the transmats must have enough power in their energy buffers. Distance does not affect the power required.
bullet_ir2_transmats_3=Both of the transmats must belong to the same force/team.
bullet_ir2_transmats_4=Usually, both of the transmats must be on the same surface or planet (third party mods can set up cross-surface connections).
bullet_ir2_transmats_5=The destination transmat will be obstructed if any engineers are standing on the platform; vehicles also obstruct platforms.

paragraph_ir2_weapons_1=IR2 adds and changes some weapon and ammo mechanics, as well as reworking the military technology tree.

bullet_ir2_weapons_1=[font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Scattergun turrets[/color][/font] are your first available automated defence. They use shotgun cartridge ammo.
bullet_ir2_weapons_2=[font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Autogun turrets[/color][/font] use magazine ammo. Bullets are projectiles with a travel time, whether fired from a turret or a hand weapon.
bullet_ir2_weapons_3=[font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Laser turrets[/color][/font] work the same way as they do in vanilla Factorio. You can change the colour of the beams in mod settings.
bullet_ir2_weapons_4=[font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Arc turrets[/color][/font] don't deal any damage but strike a cluster of enemies with an electric pulse, greatly slowing them down.
bullet_ir2_weapons_5=[font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Photonic cannons[/color][/font] release deadly explosive energy projectiles. Don't point them towards your own base.
bullet_ir2_weapons_6=The ultimate weapon is the [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]atomic artillery shell[/color][/font], which devastates enemy bases but releases a massive cloud of pollution.
