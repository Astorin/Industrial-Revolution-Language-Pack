page_IndustrialRevolution=Welcome to IR2. It is assumed that a discerning person such as yourself has more than adequate experience of vanilla Factorio, and that you can figure out basic mining, processing, crafting and research operations without a chaperone. On the left-hand menu, you can find some details on less obvious features of the mod.\n\nSome general advice:\n\n[img=bronze-bullet] If your hand-crafting queue is minutes long, you aren't automating. If you aren't automating, you're not doing it right.\n[img=bronze-bullet] Ore patches last longer because ore productivity is part of the mod's progression. The "default" map generation preset might feel too easy.\n[img=bronze-bullet] You can't smelt iron at the start of the game (unless you change mod settings in map selection).\n[img=bronze-bullet] Monowheels are unlocked early and are cheaper and faster than cars, making it easy to explore.\n[img=bronze-bullet] When you get to iron smelting, your first iron patch might be a way off; you might have to set up a secondary outpost.\n[img=bronze-bullet] Check stats before you start spamming machines down. Most things have changed so don't assume vanilla numbers.\n[img=bronze-bullet] Some map settings (e.g. pure desert worlds) can make getting hold of rubber trees quite difficult. Use a monowheel to explore or opt for a starter kit.\n[img=bronze-bullet] Carbon steel in IR2 is not "compressed iron" like vanilla steel, so it uses up much less iron ore.\n[img=bronze-bullet] Circuit networks are pretty much compulsory for some late game processing chains, ore washing in particular.\n\nThis mod was made by Deadlock989, 2018-2021, and took about 1750 hours.

page_ir2_entity_toggle=IR2 provides a hotkey that lets you adjust the behaviour of a few specific machines in the world. The current keybinding is __CONTROL__ir2-entity-adjustment__. You can change this in the game's control settings.\n\n[img=bronze-bullet] Pressing the hotkey while riding a [img=item/locomotive] [font=default-bold][color=255,230,192]locomotive[/color][/font] will toggle the train between manual and automatic modes. If you're not riding a train but pointing at one with the cursor, it will also toggle the mode of that train.\n\n[img=bronze-bullet] Pressing the hotkey while pointing at a [img=item/photon-turret] [font=default-bold][color=255,230,192]photonic cannon[/color][/font] will switch the cannon between wide and narrow arcs of fire.\n\n[img=bronze-bullet] Pressing the hotkey while pointing at an [img=item/copper-aetheric-lamp-straight] [font=default-bold][color=255,230,192]aetheric lamp[/color][/font] will switch the lamp from the default passthrough version (two connections) to a pipe-ending variant (one connection).

page_ir2_transmats=Transmats (short for "transmaterialisation platforms") are a branch of quantum field ring technology that employs hyperspatial slipstream tunnelling to transfer engineers quickly from site to site. Clicking on a transmat will open its interface and show possible destinations. You can edit the name of the transmat by clicking on the Edit button: names are preserved in blueprints and copy-pasting.\n\nIf the status for both transmats is shown as[img=transmat-ready][font=default-bold][color=255,230,192]Ready[/color][/font], transport can be initiated by clicking on the [font=default-bold][color=255,230,192]Engage[/color][/font] button. Transmat energy costs are fixed, i.e. the distance travelled and the number of engineers transported at once do not affect the energy required. Transmats can only make a connection if all of the following conditions are met:\n\n[img=bronze-bullet] At least one engineer must be standing on the initiating transmat.\n[img=bronze-bullet] Both of the transmats must have enough power in their energy buffers.\n[img=bronze-bullet] Both of the transmats must belong to the same force/team.\n[img=bronze-bullet] Usually, both of the transmats must be on the same surface or planet. (Third party mods can opt in to cross-surface transmats).\n[img=bronze-bullet] The destination transmat will be obstructed if any engineers are standing on the platform; vehicles also obstruct platforms.

page_ir2_pollution_spill=In IR2, some liquids and gases are notable pollutants. If a [font=default-bold][color=255,230,192]storage tank[/color][/font] or [font=default-bold][color=255,230,192]pipe[/color][/font] is deconstructed or destroyed while it has a polluting fluid in it, pollution is immediately released into the world. The same also applies to manually flushing a fluid system.\n\nThe amount of pollution released depends on which fluid it was, but more importantly how much fluid was "deleted". For only the contents of a single pipe piece, the released pollution is nothing to worry about. But if it was a storage tank with 25k units of fluid in it, the burst of pollution can be significant. Most risky is flushing entire fluid systems, which can be huge.\n\nThe most polluting fluid is crude oil, the least is polluted water. Molten metals and molten glass are also pollutants.

page_ir2_processing=IR2 features additional intermediate steps for ore processing, effectively boosting raw ore yields from quite early on in the game. In some cases these processes are optional - you can still smelt raw ores if you want to - but there are always benefits to extra processing.\n\n[img=item/copper-grinder][img=item/iron-grinder][img=item/steel-grinder] [font=default-bold][color=255,230,192]Crushers[/color][/font] are typically used to pulverise raw ores or reduce stone to gravel and silica. Crushing metallic ores results in an increased ingot yield. Crushers are also used to extract rubber from rubber wood.\n\n[img=item/copper-mixer][img=item/iron-mixer][img=item/steel-mixer] [font=default-bold][color=255,230,192]Mixers[/color][/font] are a specialist form of crusher that require a manual recipe selection. They are mainly used to produce alloy mixes for smelting, but they can also combine crushed materials with water to produce flooring and other products.\n\n[img=item/steel-washer] [font=default-bold][color=255,230,192]Ore washers[/color][/font] are an additional stage of ore processing which is unlocked later in the game. Washing further increases the yield of crushed ores by producing purified minerals, and it also separates out rarer metallic minerals which would otherwise be lost in the smelting process. Washing requires an additional fluid input such as water or acid, which becomes polluted during the washing process. A [img=item/steel-cleaner] [font=default-bold][color=255,230,192]polluted water cleaner[/color][/font] can be used to filter out impurities, restoring some of the clean water used in washing. [img=item/pump] [font=default-bold][color=255,230,192]Pumps[/color][/font], [img=item/small-tank] [font=default-bold][color=255,230,192]small buffer tanks[/color][/font] and [img=item/green-wire] [font=default-bold][color=255,230,192]circuit networks[/color][/font] are very likely to be useful in rigging up an unattended ore washing plant and managing the available ratios of primary metals and secondary byproducts.\n\n[img=item/iron-scrapper] [font=default-bold][color=255,230,192]Scrapping machines[/color][/font] can turn almost any crafted item into scrap, as long as the item has at least some metal, stone, wood or glass in its crafting history. Scrap can then be re-smelted into ingots or sheets. This is a good way of recovering resources from unwanted or obsolete items. The amount of scrap returned is semi-random but you are guaranteed to get at least half of the materials used to make the item, and usually more than that. Scrapping can only "reverse" crafting processes, and not smelting, grinding, or chemistry: for example, you cannot recover chrome plating from scrapped items or turn concrete back into gravel.

page_ir2_power_sources=Machines in IR2 have three different kinds of power source.\n\n[font=default-bold][color=255,230,192]Burner machines[/color][/font] are the most basic devices which require coal or some other solid chemical fuel to operate.\n\n[font=default-bold][color=255,230,192]Steam machines[/color][/font] operate by transforming pressurised steam into mechanical motion. A copper boiler is used to convert water to steam, which can then be piped to (and usually through) steam machines. In the early stages of an IR2 game, steam power is the only way to set up automated crafting and ore processing; water is carried to boilers in [img=item/copper-pipe] [font=default-bold][color=255,230,192]water pipes[/color][/font] and steam is carried from the boilers to machines using [img=item/steam-pipe] [font=default-bold][color=255,230,192]steam pipes[/color][/font]. Steam machines are all in the early copper tier.\n\nFinally, [font=default-bold][color=255,230,192]electric machines[/color][/font] require a power supply from an electric network, the same as vanilla Factorio. In IR2, electricity isn't possible before iron smelting is researched. Many electric processing machines show their operating status with coloured lights: you can adjust the colours used in Settings > Mod settings > Startup.

page_ir2_mining=IR2 features the usual resource deposits from vanilla Factorio: [img=item/coal] [font=default-bold][color=255,230,192]coal[/color][/font], [img=item/stone] [font=default-bold][color=255,230,192]stone[/color][/font], [img=item/copper-ore] [font=default-bold][color=255,230,192]copper ore[/color][/font], and [img=item/iron-ore] [font=default-bold][color=255,230,192]iron ore[/color][/font]. In addition, you will find deposits of [img=item/tin-ore] [font=default-bold][color=255,230,192]tin ore[/color][/font] and [img=item/gold-ore] [font=default-bold][color=255,230,192]gold ore[/color][/font]. The ability to smelt iron and gold requires research, so at the start of the game, your primary resources are copper and tin. \n\nOccasionally you might find an ore deposit that contains rare gemstones. These include [img=item/ruby-gem] [font=default-bold][color=255,230,192]rubies[/color][/font], [img=item/sapphire-gem] [font=default-bold][color=255,230,192]sapphires[/color][/font], and [img=item/diamond-gem] [font=default-bold][color=255,230,192]diamonds[/color][/font]. Specific gems are associated with specific kinds of ore. Not every ore patch will have gems in it. Gem-bearing ore resources can be hard to spot, although there are visual clues both in the world and on the map once you know what you are looking for.\n\nLater in the game, a high-tech method of synthesising gems becomes available. However, powdered gems (natural or synthesised) are needed to seed the crystal formation, so you need to mine at least some gems to kickstart that line of processing.

paragraph_ir2_pollution_control_1=IR2 provides machines which help to reduce or control the spread of pollution.

bullet_ir2_pollution_control_1=[font=default-bold][color=255,230,192]Forestries[/color][/font] are mainly used to grow wood, but they also have a small anti-pollution effect.

bullet_ir2_pollution_control_2=[font=default-bold][color=255,230,192]Air purification towers[/color][/font] are more effective, but they consume resources.

paragraph_ir2_pollution_control_2=In Factorio, pollution is "chunk-based". The world is divided into squares of 32x32 tiles, called chunks. Each chunk has a pollution value. Pollution spreads gradually to neighbouring chunks, and some natural features reduce the pollution as it spreads. If a machine produces emissions, they are added to the pollution value of the chunk the machine is in. If a machine has negative emissions, it is subtracted from the pollution in that chunk until there is none left. IR2 displays an [font=default-bold][color=255,230,192]alt-mode highlight[/color][/font] when you point the cursor at any machine that has a negative pollution effect, which indicates the boundary of the chunk it is affecting. Since a chunk's pollution cannot go below zero, you may want to avoid having too many anti-pollution machines in the same chunk.

paragraph_ir2_fuelman_1=IR2 provides equipment grid generators that burn fuel or discharge batteries. Other mods may also provide them. Keeping equipment fuel slots topped up by hand can be tedious. Fortunately, in IR2, you can automate it.

paragraph_ir2_fuelman_2=If you have any generators in your power armour or if you are driving a vehicle that needs fuel, the fuel manager quickbar toggle will be unlocked. If the manager is toggled on and any fuel levels get too low, the manager will try to top them up with the same kind of fuel. If there are any spent items (such as empty batteries), the manager will try to clear them out. If any items are moved in or out of inventories, a notification will appear above your character, showing how many. If the fuel manager encounters an issue, the notification will include warning icons:

bullet_ir2_fuelman_1=A fuel inventory needs topping up, but you don't have any of the same fuel available.

bullet_ir2_fuelman_2=An empty fuel inventory was found. No action is taken because the manager does not know which fuel you would prefer to use.

bullet_ir2_fuelman_3=A "spent fuel" inventory has items in it, but there is no space for them anywhere else.

paragraph_ir2_fuelman_3=While you are driving, the vehicle's fuel and its equipment grid are managed in the same way as your armour equipment, and the manager has access to both your personal inventory and the vehicle's trunk. For your armour equipment, your inventory has priority over the trunk. For the vehicle, the trunk has priority. Locomotives and wagons do not count as "driving" and are not managed.

paragraph_ir2_fuelman_4=You can disable specific warnings and sounds: see Settings > Mod settings > Per player.
