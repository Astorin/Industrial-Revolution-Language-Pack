paragraph_ir-airships_1=[img=item/hydrogen-airship] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Airships[/color][/font] hover above buildings and can cross water. They require fuel to move, but they use it efficiently. They are not fast, but they benefit from vehicle speed bonuses on fuel; helium airships are slightly faster. They can be piloted by players, moving WASD-style. They can also be directed on autopilot by a remote. If airships are destroyed, any human occupants are killed, and hydrogen airships will ignite the ground around them.
paragraph_ir-airships_2=[img=item/airship-station] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Airship stations[/color][/font] act as routing hubs for airships, allowing you to create an automated logistics system. Airships dock with stations if their final autopilot waypoint arrives at one. Stations do not have an inventory of their own, but they can access the inventories of adjacent containers (up to sixteen 1x1 chests). Stations are not unlike train stops in that they can be named destinations. However, unlike locomotives, airships do not have schedules: all of the routing is done by the stations. It is possible for multiple stations to be given the same name, but each remains a unique destination. Changing a station's name will not change any routes; destinations will simply reflect the new name. 
paragraph_ir-airships_3=In each station's GUI, you can configure how docking is handled. Docking has stages: refuelling, then unloading, then loading, then forwarding. Stations can have up to __1__ unloading and loading instructions, each optionally filterable by airship colour and item. They also have up to __1__ possible forwarding destinations (other stations), filterable by airship colour. Loading and unloading instructions can conditionally change an airship's colour, for example, depending on inventory space or fuel level. Airships can also be given a colour unconditionally when they dock. Cargo instructions are always processed in order and all of them are checked. If an instruction changes an airship's colour, the new colour counts for all the instructions that follow. You can use all of these features to conditionally skip instructions and send airships to different destinations. For example, here is a schedule which loads orange airships with copper ore, colours them black if they need fuel, and otherwise colours them red if they aren't full:
paragraph_ir-airships_4=With destinations, the airship is sent to the first that matches the airship's colour and any further destinations are ignored. Stations can also choose themselves as a "circle and return" destination: the airship will leave the station, orbit for a while, and then spiral back and dock again. When used in combination with conditional colours, circle and return is the airship equivalent of a wait condition. In the loading schedule example above, you would set a refuelling destination filtered for black, a circle and return destination filtered for red, and an ore drop-off location filtered for orange. If no forwarding destination can be matched, airships will park at a random location nearby; you can choose to be alerted if this happens. 
paragraph_ir-airships_5=If an airship was parked or stopped by a player, using the IR3 toggle hotkey on it (__CONTROL__ir-entity-adjustment__) will resume its previous journey. Copy-pasting from one station to another transfers all station settings, including the station's name; this cannot be undone. Station settings are not preserved in blueprints.
