ir-basic-research=You are inspired to automate.
ir-basic-wood=There must be some decent lumber here somewhere.
ir-blunderbuss=Just in case something goes bump in the night.
ir-brass-alloying=It's not quite brass as you remember it from home, but it's tough, slippery, and very machinable, so close enough.
ir-brass-milestone=Brass components.
ir-bronze-alloying=Bronze is a strong and corrosion-resistant alloy, with properties exceeding those of tin and copper.
ir-bronze-milestone=Bronze components.
ir-charcoal=You dimly recall where metal comes from. Something about cooking rocks?

ir-electrum-alloying=An advanced crystalline alloy with exceptional durability and unusual electromagnetic properties.
ir-electrum-milestone=Electrum applications.
ir-glass-alloying=Stannosilicate glass. Transparent and a good insulator, but shatters easily.

ir-gold-milestone=Gold foil, essential for advanced electronics.
ir-gold-smelting=Time passes ... You sit down and start singing about gold.
ir-iron-milestone=Iron components.

paragraph_ir_inspiration_1=Some technologies are not unlocked by labs. They require [img=inspiration] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]inspiration[/color][/font]. There are two kinds of inspiration.
paragraph_ir_inspiration_2=For most inspired technologies, you need to obtain a new resource. This might be achieved by manual harvesting, or hand-crafting, or factory processes. An example is [img=technology/ir-copper-working-1] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]copper-working[/color][/font]. When you unlock stone furnaces, you also unlock the copper ingot recipes. Once you have smelted at least __1__ copper ingots, the first tier of copper-working is unlocked automatically, inspiring you to fashion the ingots into components and opening up further technologies. This is different to the default IR3 tech tree, where you can sometimes unlock a new material and then research a dozen applications for it without ever producing a single nugget.  
paragraph_ir_inspiration_3=The other kind of inspiration is not based on resources. Technologies can be unlocked automatically once all of their prerequisite technologies have been unlocked. An example is [img=technology/ir-charcoal] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]stone furnaces[/color][/font]: when you have unlocked both of the prerequisite wood and stone technologies, stone furnace designs will occur to you in a flash of inspiration.
