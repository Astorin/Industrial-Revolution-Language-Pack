[mod-setting-description]
ir3ls-belt-snapping=If this option is on, connecting any newly placed loader to a belt will change the output mode of the loader to match the belt direction.
ir3ls-enabled=Allows you to activate only the features you want.
ir3ls-batch-mode=By default, stackers produce individual stacked items. In batch mode, ingot stacking is processed in batches of four, taking four times as long to produce four stacked items. Batch mode encourages output loaders to use both sides of the belt; the minor drawback is that low levels of throughput can become "clumpy". Unstacking recipes are not batched (they already produce multiple items).

[technology-description]
ir3-loader=Loaders rapidly fill or empty out containers, train wagons and machines, utilising an entire belt's throughput.
ir3-beltbox=Feed items into a stacker to stack them; feed the stacked items into another stacker to unstack them again. Works with ingots, bars, sheets and bricks. Best used with loaders. Does not increase inventory density, but increases belt throughput and inventory transfer rates by a factor of four.
