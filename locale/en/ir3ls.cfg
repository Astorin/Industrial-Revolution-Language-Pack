ir3ls-belt-snapping=If this option is on, connecting any newly placed loader to a belt will change the output mode of the loader to match the belt direction.
ir3ls-enabled=Allows you to activate only the features you want.
ir3ls-batch-mode=By default, stackers produce individual stacked items. In batch mode, ingot stacking is processed in batches of four, taking four times as long to produce four stacked items. Batch mode encourages output loaders to use both sides of the belt; the minor drawback is that low levels of throughput can become "clumpy". Unstacking recipes are not batched (they already produce multiple items).

paragraph_ir-stacking_1=[img=item/ir3-express-loader] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Loaders[/color][/font] allow you to funnel a belt's entire throughput into a container or machine, or rapidly empty an inventory onto a belt. They work with chests and similar containers, cargo wagons in trains, and crafting/processing machines. They require power to operate (steam or electricity, depending on tier). Each tier of loader matches the speed of the corresponding belt tier. Note that with crafting machines, loaders don't respect inserter input limits, so they will pack the machine's input slots with as many items as they can.
paragraph_ir-stacking_2=A loader's facing direction cannot be rotated after being placed: the rotate key (__CONTROL__rotate__) toggles the loader between input and output mode instead. Loaders can be filtered in output mode only. If loader-to-belt snapping is active (see Settings > Mod settings > Map), newly placed loaders will automatically change their input/output mode to match a connected belt's direction.
paragraph_ir-stacking_3=[img=item/ir3-express-beltbox] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Stackers[/color][/font] are small machines designed to work with loaders. They provide a way to quadruple belt throughput, but only for ingots and some other brick-shaped items. You can get a list of stackable items by pointing your mouse at a stacker's empty input slot. Feed ingots into a stacker with a loader, and it will produce stacked ingots. Feed those stacked ingots into another stacker and they will be unstacked again. Stacked items can't be used in recipes, so a typical procedure is to stack them at the start of a bus, and then unstack them at the entrances to sub-factories.
paragraph_ir-stacking_4=Stackers can be adjusted to use "batch mode" (see Settings > Mod settings > Startup). This encourages loaders to use both lanes of the belt when unloading stacked items, at the cost of requiring a larger buffer of input items.
