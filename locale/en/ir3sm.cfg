paragraph_ir-spacemining_1=Deep space mining is where rocket launching technology and quantum transmaterialisation converge, allowing you to extract resources from space. Instead of transporting engineers, [img=item/cargo-transmat] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]cargo transmats[/color][/font] connect to [img=item/quantum-satellite] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]deep space mining probes[/color][/font], which are launched into space by [img=item/rocket-silo] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]rockets[/color][/font]. Probes require significant investment to launch, but once launched, they last forever. Every launched probe joins the swarm and explores the local solar system, collecting resources. The more probes you launch, the bigger your daily haul.
paragraph_ir-spacemining_2=All four metallic terrestrial ores can be mined from asteroids, as well as [img=item/comet-ice-ore] [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]comet ice[/color][/font], a source of natural gas and water. Resources have varying rarities: iron ore is the most common. Once per Factorio day (roughly every 7 minutes), the probe swarm attempts to make cargo transmat connections to deliver its haul. Like regular transmats, there must be __1__MJ of power available in the cargo transmat's buffer to establish a transfer. If a cargo transmat has insufficient power or storage capacity, the swarm will try to connect with another. Cargo transmats do not have their own storage but utilise any containers placed directly next to them: use alt-mode to see which containers a transmat is attached to. You can use filtered containers to control which ores any particular transmat can receive.
paragraph_ir-spacemining_3=If your probes cannot deliver all of their haul, they will try again the next day. However, the swarm has a maximum storage capacity per ore type, which scales with probes launched. If that capacity is reached, probes will not gather any more of that resource until they can offload it. You can have a maximum of __1__ probes active, and a maximum of __2__ cargo transmats: probes launched or transmats constructed beyond that will not be productive. Opening a cargo transmat's interface gives you information about the current state of your probes.
