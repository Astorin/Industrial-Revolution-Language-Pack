ir2-fuelman-inventorysounds=Fuel manager inventory transfers make a quiet sound.
ir2-fuelman-pingemptyslot=Alert if any fuel slots are completely empty. Only shown if the fuel manager is active (quickbar shortcut).
ir2-fuelman-pingnofuel=Alert if any fuel slots are below the threshold but there is no matching fuel in your armour or vehicle inventories. Only shown if the fuel manager is active (quickbar shortcut).
ir2-fuelman-pingnoinv=Alert if any spent fuel slots contain items to discard but your armour or vehicle inventories are full. Only shown if the fuel manager is active (quickbar shortcut).
ir2-fuelman-pingsounds=Alerts play a sound.
ir2-hide-redundancies=Hides basic products that have no known use (if any exist) from crafting tabs, making them non-craftable. They are still shown in technology unlocks. Mostly for debugging purposes, not really useful to players.
ir2-inserter-adjustment=When enabled, the side of the belt inserters drop onto can be adjusted with a hotkey. Disable this option if you want to use another inserter mod instead.
ir2-laser-colour=Choose the hue of laser beams (turrets, destroyers, PLD).
ir2-no-blue-trees=If turned on, caps the blue channel of tree foliage colouration at 80% of the green channel's value (i.e. banishes weird blue trees).
ir2-starting-age=Choose whether to start in the default "stone age", or pre-research whole tiers of tech. Only affects new game creation.
ir2-starting-kit=Turning this on gives you a bonus starter kit dependent on your starting tech level. Only affects new game creation.
ir2-status-disabled=Shown when the machine is disabled by circuit network signal (drills only). Also used on machine GUIs for any "non-working" status other than low power.
ir2-status-full-output=Shown when the machine cannot operate (e.g. the output is blocked or it is busy with some other task).
ir2-status-idle=Shown when the machine has nothing to do (crafting machines only).
ir2-status-insufficient-input=Shown when the machine doesn't have enough ingredients to complete its task (crafting machines only).
ir2-status-low-power=Shown when the available power supply or buffer charge is insufficient.
ir2-status-no-minable-resources=Shown when the drill has run out of resources to mine (drills only).
ir2-status-working=Shown when the machine is working or ready to activate.
ir2-rail-blocks=The colours used for rail block visualisations (e.g. when holding a signal over rails).
ir2-research-notifications=Shows a notification when you or your team have completed research. Only useful with research queues.
ir2-turret-runtime=By default, turrets in the world are tinted the same colour as the owning player or force. You can choose instead to have each turret use the same fixed tint as its icon.
