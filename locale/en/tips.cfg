ir2-introduction=Welcome to IR2. It is assumed that a discerning person such as yourself has more than adequate experience of vanilla Factorio, and that you can figure out basic mining, processing, crafting and research operations without a chaperone. On the left-hand menu, you can find some details on less obvious features of the mod.\n\nSome general advice:\n\n[img=bronze-bullet] If your hand-crafting queue is minutes long, you aren't automating. If you aren't automating, you're not doing it right.\n[img=bronze-bullet] Ore patches last longer because ore productivity is part of the mod's progression from very early on. The "default" map generation preset might feel a bit easy.\n[img=bronze-bullet] You can't smelt iron at the start of the game (unless you change mod settings in map selection). Don't make your habitual beeline for the nearest iron ore patch.\n[img=bronze-bullet] Monowheels are unlocked early and are cheaper and faster than cars, making it easy to explore. Be careful in enemy territory: monowheels are unarmed.\n[img=bronze-bullet] When you get to iron smelting, your first iron patch might be a way off. If so, you might have to set up a secondary outpost to bootstrap electricity and rail.\n[img=bronze-bullet] Check stats on machine tooltips before you start spamming them down. Most things have changed so don't assume vanilla ratios of anything, especially drills.\n[img=bronze-bullet] Some map settings (e.g. pure desert worlds) can make getting hold of rubber trees quite difficult. Use a monowheel to explore or opt for a starter kit.\n[img=bronze-bullet] Carbon steel in IR2 is not "compressed iron" like vanilla steel, so it uses up much less iron ore. But it requires more infrastructure to make.\n[img=bronze-bullet] Circuit networks are pretty much compulsory for some late game processing chains, ore washing in particular.\n\nThis mod was made by Deadlock989, 2018-2021, and took about 1500 hours.

ir2-genman=IR2 features equipment grid generators that burn fuel items or discharge batteries. Other mods may also provide them. Keeping equipment fuel slots topped up by hand can get pretty tedious. Fortunately, you can automate it.\n\nIf you are wearing armour that is equipped with generators that have fuel slots, or if you are driving a vehicle equipped with them, then the generator manager quickbar toggle will be unlocked. You can toggle it on by clicking on it or using the hotkey (currently bound to __CONTROL__ir2-control-generator-manager__).\n\nWhen activated, the manager will check your generators a few times every minute. If any fuel levels fall below a certain threshold, the manager will look in your inventory for the same fuel and top them up, if possible. If it moves items in or out of your inventory, small flying icons will briefly appear above your character, indicating how many items were used or returned.\n\nIf your equipment grid(s) have any completely empty generators, you will see a [img=fuel-icon-red] warning above your character. The manager will not take any action because it does not know which fuel you would like to use.\n\nIf there are any generators that need topping up but you don't have any of the same fuel in your inventory, a different colour [img=fuel-icon-yellow] warning is shown.\n\nIf the generator has an output slot (for example, battery dischargers accept [img=item/charged-battery] charged batteries and output [img=item/battery] discharged batteries), the manager will empty that slot out into your inventory if it can. If it cannot because your inventory is full, you will see a different [img=fuel-icon-inventory] warning.\n\nYou can enable and disable specific warnings in Settings > Mod settings > Per player. You can also leave the visual warnings on but turn off the sounds.

ir2-entity-toggle=IR2 provides a hotkey that lets you adjust the behaviour of a few specific machines in the world. The current keybinding is __CONTROL__ir2-entity-adjustment__. You can change this in the game's control settings.\n\n[img=bronze-bullet] If you use the hotkey while riding a [img=item/locomotive] train, the train will be toggled between manual and automatic modes.\n\n[img=bronze-bullet] If you're not riding a train but pointing at one with the mouse cursor, it also toggles the mode of that train.\n\n[img=bronze-bullet] If you use the hotkey while pointing at a [img=item/photon-turret] photonic cannon, the cannon will switch between wide and narrow arcs of fire.\n\n[img=bronze-bullet] If you use the hotkey while pointing at an [img=item/copper-aetheric-lamp-straight] aetheric lamp, the lamp will be switched from the default passthrough version (i.e. steam flows through it to other pipes) to a pipe-ending variant with only one connection.

ir2-transmats=Transmats (short for "transmaterialisation platforms") are a branch of quantum field ring technology that employs hyperspatial slipstream tunnelling to transfer engineers quickly from site to site. Clicking on a transmat will open its interface and show any possible destinations along with a coloured status symbol. You can edit the name of the transmat by clicking on the Edit button: names are preserved in blueprints and copy-pasting. If the status symbol for both transmats is shown as [img=transmat-ready] [font=default-semibold]Energy full, ready for operation[/font], transport can be initiated by clicking on the destination's map preview. Transmat energy costs are fixed, i.e. the distance travelled and the number of engineers transported at once do not affect the energy required.\n\nTwo transmats can only form a slipstream connection if all of the following conditions are true:\n\n[img=bronze-bullet] At least one engineer must be standing on the initiating transmat, within the quantum field ring.\n[img=bronze-bullet] Both of the transmats must have adequate power stored in their energy buffers.\n[img=bronze-bullet] Both of the transmats must belong to the same force/team.\n[img=bronze-bullet] In normal circumstances, both of the transmats must be on the same surface or planet. (Third party mods can opt in to cross-surface transmats).\n[img=bronze-bullet] Destination transmats will be blocked if any engineers are standing on them. Both ends can be blocked if any vehicle is parked on them.\n\nIn theory, quantum field fluctuations might disrupt the use of transmats on specific planets. Users who find themselves unable to transport, or who find that their flesh has been permanently fused with an alien lifeform, should submit a detailed report and a sequenced genome sample to the regional hyperspatial slipstream regulation authority.

ir2-pollution-spill=In IR2, some liquids and gases are notable pollutants. If a storage tank or pipe is deconstructed or destroyed while it has a polluting fluid in it, pollution is immediately released into the world. The same also applies to manually flushing a fluid system.\n\nThe amount of pollution released depends on which fluid it was, but more importantly how much fluid was "deleted". For only the contents of a single pipe piece, the released pollution is nothing to worry about. But if it was a storage tank with 25k units of fluid in it, the burst of pollution can be significant. Most risky is flushing entire fluid systems, which can be huge. The most polluting fluid is crude oil, the least is polluted water.\n\nThe following fluids are pollutants:\n\n__1__\nAll molten metals and molten glass are also pollutants.

ir2-processing=All crafting components are derived from ores, stone, wood, oil and water. In vanilla Factorio, the main processes for turning raw resources into useful components are crafting (assembling machines), smelting (furnaces), and chemistry (chemical plants); raw resource productivity is usually only boosted by modules and mining research. IR2 features additional processes and more intermediate steps for ore processing, effectively boosting raw ore yields from quite early on. In some cases these processes are optional - you can still smelt raw ores - but there are always benefits to adding extra processing.\n\n[img=item/copper-grinder][img=item/iron-grinder][img=item/steel-grinder] [font=default-semibold]Crushers[/font] are typically used to pulverise raw ores or reduce stone to gravel and silica. Crushing metallic ores results in an increased ingot yield. Crushers are also used to extract rubber from rubber wood.\n\n[img=item/copper-mixer][img=item/iron-mixer][img=item/steel-mixer] [font=default-semibold]Mixers[/font] are a specialist form of crusher. They are mainly used to produce alloy mixes for smelting, but they can also combine crushed materials with water to produce flooring and other products.\n\n[img=item/steel-washer] [font=default-semibold]Ore washers[/font] are an additional stage of ore processing which is unlocked later in the game. Washing further increases the yield of crushed ores by producing purified minerals, and it also separates out rarer metallic minerals which would otherwise be lost in the smelting process. Washing requires an additional fluid input such as water or acid, which becomes polluted during the washing process. A [img=item/steel-cleaner] [font=default-semibold]polluted water cleaner[/font] can be used to filter out impurities, restoring some of the clean water used in washing. [img=item/pump] [font=default-semibold]Pumps[/font], [img=item/small-tank] [font=default-semibold]small buffer tanks[/font] and [img=item/green-wire] [font=default-semibold]circuit networks[/font] are very likely to be useful in rigging up an unattended ore washing plant and managing the available ratios of primary metals and secondary byproducts.\n\n[img=item/iron-scrapper] [font=default-semibold]Scrapping machines[/font] can turn almost any crafted item into scrap, as long as the item has at least some metal, stone, wood or glass in its crafting history. Scrap can then be re-smelted into ingots or sheets. This is a good way of recovering resources from unwanted or obsolete items. The amount of scrap returned is semi-random but you are guaranteed to get at least half of the materials used to make the item, and usually more than that. Scrapping can only "reverse" crafting processes, and not smelting, chemistry or electroplating: for example, you cannot recover plastic or chrome plating from scrapped items.

ir2-power-sources=Machines in IR2 have three different kinds of power source.\n\n[font=default-semibold]Burner machines[/font] are the most basic devices which require coal or some other solid chemical fuel to operate. Examples include [img=item/burner-mining-drill] copper mining drills, [img=item/burner-inserter] burner inserters, [img=item/copper-boiler] boilers, and [img=item/stone-furnace] furnaces.\n\n[font=default-semibold]Steam machines[/font] operate by transforming pressurised steam into mechanical motion. A copper boiler is used to convert water to steam, which can then be piped to (and usually through) steam machines. In the early stages of an IR2 game, steam power is the only way to set up automated crafting and ore processing; water is carried to boilers in [img=item/copper-pipe] water pipes and steam is carried from the boilers to machines using [img=item/steam-pipe] steam pipes. Steam machines are all in the early copper tier and include [img=item/assembling-machine-1] assembling machines, [img=item/pipe-inserter] steam inserters, [img=item/copper-lab] copper laboratories, [img=item/copper-mixer] mixers, and [img=item/copper-grinder] crushers.\n\nFinally, [font=default-semibold]electric machines[/font] require a power supply from an electric network, the same as vanilla Factorio. In IR2, electricity isn't possible before iron smelting is researched. Many electric processing machines show their operating status with coloured lights: you can adjust the colours used in Settings > Mod settings > Startup.
